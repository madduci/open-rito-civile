This project is a simple Docker/AsciiDoc powered document for an Italian Wedding Ceremony, fully customizable (and of course, modifiable).

It contains a preset of standard Italian Civil Rights quotes and small suggestions for the full ceremony, including the "Sand Ceremony".

I've decided to share my work (dated to August 2016), as a resource for nerds like me to speed up their wedding preparation.

The `booklet-theme.yml` can be adjusted with custom fonts and colors (my wedding main color was Turquoise)
